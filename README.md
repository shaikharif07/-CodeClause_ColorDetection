# Color_Detection

Name of Project- Color Detection from an image

Description- How many times has it occurred to you that even after seeing you don't remember the name of the color? There can be 16 million colors based on the different RGB color values but we only remember a few. So in this project we are going to build an interactive app that will detect the selected color from any image. To implement this we will need a labeled data of all the known colors then we will calculate which color resembles the most with the selected color value.

Programming Languages- Python
